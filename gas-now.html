    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>
    <div class="faq">
      <h3>What are ETH gas fees right now?</h3>
      <p>ETH gas fees are transaction fees that you pay when interacting with the Ethereum network. They vary depending on network congestion and transaction complexity.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq">
      <h3>What are crypto gas fees?</h3>
      <p>Crypto gas fees are the costs required to conduct transactions or interact with smart contracts on blockchain networks. These fees are paid to miners or validators who process transactions.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq">
      <h3>What is the current Gwei price?</h3>
      <p>Gwei is a unit of measurement for gas fees on the Ethereum network. It represents a fraction of 1 ETH and is used to price transactions and smart contract executions.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq">
      <h3>Why do Gwei prices fluctuate?</h3>
      <p>Gwei prices fluctuate based on the network's demand. When more people use the network, the Gwei price increases due to higher competition for block space.</p>

    <h2>What Are Gas Fees?</h2>
    <p>At its core, 'gas' is defined as the unit that measures the computational effort required to execute different types of actions while interacting with a blockchain. It can be thought of as the "fuel" needed to power operations on the network. Public blockchains, being open networks accessible to anyone with an internet connection, require a mechanism to control activity. This is where gas fees come in: a fee is charged using cryptocurrency for operations performed on the blockchain.</p>
    <p>Gas fees are essentially transaction fees paid by users to compensate the network participants – typically miners or validators – for the computational resources needed to process and validate transactions, smart contracts, and other operations. On decentralized networks, transactions and smart contract executions are handled by multiple nodes across the network, not a single entity. Gas fees incentivize these participants to process transactions and maintain the network's security and functionality.</p>
    <p>Besides compensating validators, gas fees serve a vital role in preventing network abuse. Without a cost attached to operations, malicious actors could easily spam the network with a massive number of transactions, potentially clogging it and disrupting service. By requiring a payment for each operation, gas creates a real cost to attempting to disrupt the network, similar to how charging for email would combat spam email. This mechanism helps ensure that the network remains functional and accessible for legitimate users.</p>
    <p><strong>Ethereum Gas Fees Explained</strong></p>
    <p>Ethereum is the most popular smart contract platform and where the concept of gas fees is most widely recognized. On Ethereum, the transaction fee is specifically referred to as the gas fee or gas price. Every action on the Ethereum network, from simple transactions to deploying smart contracts, requires computational resources and thus uses gas. The fee for this computational work is paid using ETH, the native token of the Ethereum network. Even if a transaction fails, the gas spent to attempt the execution is still lost.</p>
    <p>Gas prices on Ethereum are quoted in Gwei. Gwei is a smaller denomination of Ether, specifically one billionth of an ETH (1 Gwei = 0.000000001 ETH). Using Gwei simplifies the calculation and expression of gas fees for users compared to using the full unit of Ether. The term 'Gwei' is a contraction of 'giga-wei', inspired by Wei Dai, a computational scientist, with 'Wei' being the smallest denomination of Ether.</p>
    <p><strong>How Are Gas Fees Calculated on Ethereum?</strong></p>
    <p>The calculation of gas fees on Ethereum is based on two primary factors: the Gas Limit and the Gas Price.</p>
    <p><strong>1. Gas Limit:</strong> The Gas Limit refers to the maximum amount of gas a user is willing to pay for a transaction. Different operations on the blockchain require varying amounts of computational resources, measured in units of gas. More complex operations consume more gas units. For example, a simple ETH transfer may cost 21,000 units of gas, whereas a smart contract execution might cost much more.</p>
    <p><strong>2. Gas Price:</strong> The Gas Price is the amount of Gwei the user is willing to pay per unit of gas. The higher the gas price, the more attractive the transaction is to miners (or validators in proof-of-stake systems). This is why gas prices tend to rise during network congestion, as users compete to get their transactions processed quickly.</p>
    <p>The total transaction fee is calculated as:</p>
    <p><strong>Transaction Fee = Gas Limit × Gas Price</strong></p>
